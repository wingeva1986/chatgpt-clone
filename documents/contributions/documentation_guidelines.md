# Documentation Guidelines

- ## ⚠️Keep it organized and structured⚠️
 - For new features, create new documents and place them in the appropriate folder(s)
 - When you create a new document, do not forget to add it to the table of content
 - Add a shortcut that point back to the [README.MD](../../README.md) in the new documents
 - Do not add unrelated information to an existing document, create a new one if needed
 - For incremental updates, you need to update the main **README.MD** and **CHANGELOG.MD** 
	 - In the main README update the part where the last version is shown and the features section if needed
