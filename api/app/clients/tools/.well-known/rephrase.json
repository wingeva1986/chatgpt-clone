The plugin evaluates user inputs and, if necessary, transforms them into clearer, more specific, and contextual prompts. It processes a JSON object containing the user input to be rephrased and uses the GPT-3.5-turbo model for the rephrasing process. The rephrased input is then returned as raw data to be incorporated into ChatGPT's response. The user can initiate the plugin by typing 'perfect'.",
