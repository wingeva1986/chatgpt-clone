**Get your Bing Access Token**
   
  Please follow the **[updated instructions.](https://github.com/danny-avila/chatgpt-clone/issues/370#issuecomment-1560382302)**
  
  ~~Using MS Edge, navigate to bing.com~~
   - ~~Make sure you are logged in~~
   - ~~Open the DevTools by pressing F12 on your keyboard~~
   - ~~Click on the tab "Application" (On the left of the DevTools)~~
   - ~~Expand the "Cookies" (Under "Storage")~~
   - ~~Copy the value of the "\_U" cookie~~


## Setup Instruction
  - Create a .env file in the api directory by running cp api/.env.example api/.env and edit the file with your preferred text editor, adding the required API keys, access tokens, and MongoDB connection string
  - Run npm ci from root directory `npm ci`
  - Build the client by running `npm run frontend`

**Download MeiliSearch for macOS (optional):**
  - You can download the latest MeiliSearch binary for macOS from their GitHub releases page: https://github.com/meilisearch/MeiliSearch/releases. Look for the file named meilisearch-macos-amd64 (or the equivalent for your system architecture) and download it.

**Make the binary executable:**
  - Open Terminal and navigate to the directory where you downloaded the MeiliSearch binary. Run the following command to make it executable:

```
chmod +x meilisearch-macos-amd64
```

**Run MeiliSearch:**
  - Now that the binary is executable, you can start MeiliSearch by running the following command, replacing your_master_key_goes_here with your desired master key:

```
./meilisearch-macos-amd64 --master-key your_master_key_goes_here
```

  - MeiliSearch will start running on the default port, which is 7700. You can now use MeiliSearch in your ChatGPT-Clone project.

  - Remember to include the MeiliSearch URL and Master Key in your .env file in the api directory. Your .env file should include the following lines:

```
MEILISEARCH_URL=http://127.0.0.1:7700
MEILISEARCH_KEY=your_master_key_goes_here
```

  - With MeiliSearch running and configured, the ChatGPT-Clone project should now have the Conversation search feature enabled.

  - In the chatgpt-clone directory, start the application by running `npm run backend`
Visit http://localhost:3080 (default port) & enjoy

## Optional but recommended:

  - Create a script to automate the starting process by creating a new file named start_chatgpt.sh in the chatgpt-clone directory and pasting the following code:

```
#!/bin/bash
# Replace "your_master_key_goes_here" with your MeiliSearch Master Key
if [ -x "$(command -v ./meilisearch)" ]; then
    ./meilisearch --master-key your_master_key_goes_here &
fi
npm run backend
```

**Make the script executable by running** 

```
  chmod +x start_chatgpt.sh
```

  **Start ChatGPT-Clone by running** 
```
  ./start_chatgpt.sh
```


## **Update**
- run `git pull` from the root dir
- Run npm ci from root directory `npm ci`
- Build the client by running `npm run frontend`
